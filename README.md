## Millivolt Meter firmware
This is a "simple" firmware for the Scullcom Hobby Electronics 6 1/2 digit
millivolt meter. It's based of the original firmware discussed in the video
with some updates to accelerate the main loop and increase button
responsiveness.

You can find the build videos for the meter here:

This firmware allows you to display the voltage, store a simple calibration
offset and change the number of digits to be displayed.
